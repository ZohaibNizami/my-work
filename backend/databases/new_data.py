#     git pull <remote> <branch>

# If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

#     git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> codwith-z

# (env) mona@Monas-MacBook-Pro mywork % git push
# fatal: The current branch codwith-z has no upstream branch.
# To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

#     git push --set-upstream origin codwith-z

# To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
# upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
